# DO NOT PLAY THE CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW
you can play the first level but the second one will crash your game
# oh fuck the bugs have guns
uh oh spaghettio!!!

you are a building drone that was on a cargo ship that went boom
for some reason you get on a escape pod and leave despite just being a building drone

the ship contained a lot of guns
the bugs of the planet have guns now

run
# manufacture
DO THINGS SUCH AS
- mine ores
- mine ores (from wall)
- refine ores
- melt ores
- make alloys
- forget to wire the turrets
- die
# protec
the bugs want your oil (not really they just like murder)
- put turrets
- plan for each bug
- forget about the turrets
- die

this is not very developed rn (neither is anything)
# capture
crash land on a planet? capture it!!!! get rid of those pesky bugs!
maybe a story you find? idk im one person (and not a talented one)
